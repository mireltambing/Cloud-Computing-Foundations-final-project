The best way to use this repo is to "fork it". You can refer to the book Cloud Computing for Data, Chapter 02, to get a full walkthrough of the Hugo Continuous Delivery Setup.

Your Tasks
1. Create a Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.
2. Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.
3. (Optional) Share your portfolio project on Social Media with the hashtag: #duke-cloud-computing-for-data
